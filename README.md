# Pico y Placa Predictor ðŸš¦

The Pico y Placa is a vehicle restriction measure implemented in different cities. It's a transport demand
management measure to ration the use of a scarse supply of transport vehicles in the roads due of excessive demand.

This is an application which helps to predict if you can drive or not in a specific day based on the Pico y Placa
information of Quito - Ecuador city.

_Note to take in mind: Holidays were sourced from the Google Calendar API to avoid hard-coded holiday dates and this 
may vary a little from local holiday as holiday day could be moved by the government._
